# Question: How do you implement a text editor that supports undo and redo operations? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a simple text editor that supports undo and redo operations. The TextEditor class maintains the current text and two stacks, one for undo operations and another for redo operations. When new text is typed, the current text is pushed onto the undo stack before the new text is appended to the current text. The redo stack is cleared to ensure that it only contains text that has been undone. When an undo operation is performed, the current text is pushed onto the redo stack and the last text from the undo stack is restored as the current text. Conversely, when a redo operation is performed, the current text is pushed onto the undo stack and the last text from the redo stack is restored as the current text. The Print method is used to display the current text. The Main method demonstrates the use of these operations by typing text, undoing the last operation, and then redoing it.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution is similar to the C# version in terms of the overall logic and approach. Both versions use two stacks to keep track of the changes made to the text and to support undo and redo operations. However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of Python and C#.

1. Initialization: In the C# version, the `TextEditor` class has private fields for the text, undo stack, and redo stack, which are initialized directly. In the Python version, the `TextEditor` class has an `__init__` method (constructor) where the text, stack (undo stack), and redo stack are initialized.

2. Stack Operations: In C#, the `Stack` class is used for the undo and redo stacks, and it provides `Push` and `Pop` methods for adding and removing elements. In Python, lists are used as stacks, and the `append` and `pop` methods are used for adding and removing elements.

3. Length/Count: In C#, the `Count` property is used to get the number of elements in a stack. In Python, the `len` function is used to get the number of elements in a list.

4. Printing: In C#, `Console.WriteLine` is used to print the text. In Python, the `print` function is used.

5. Main Function: In C#, the `Main` method is used as the entry point of the program. In Python, a `main` function is defined and called in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

6. User Interaction: The Python version includes a user interaction loop in the `main` function, allowing the user to choose operations (insert, undo, redo, print, exit) and input text. The C# version does not have this feature; it simply demonstrates the operations with hardcoded text and actions.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is very similar to the C# version. Both versions use two stacks to keep track of the undo and redo operations. The main difference is in the way they interact with the user and display the results.

In the C# version, the `Print` method is used to display the current text to the console. In the Java version, the current text is displayed after each operation in the `main` method. The Java version also uses a `getText` method to return the current text, while the C# version does not have a similar method.

Another difference is in the way the two versions handle user input. The C# version has a fixed sequence of operations that are performed in the `Main` method. The Java version, on the other hand, uses a `Scanner` to read commands from the user in a loop until the user types "exit". This makes the Java version more interactive and flexible, as the user can perform any sequence of operations.

In terms of language features, the C# version uses properties (e.g., `Count`) and methods (e.g., `Push`, `Pop`, `Clear`) of the `Stack` class, while the Java version uses methods of the `Stack` class (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `isEmpty`, `clear`). The Java version also uses the `switch` statement to handle different commands, while the C# version does not have a similar construct.

In summary, both versions solve the problem in a similar way, but the Java version is more interactive and flexible due to its use of a command loop and a `Scanner` for user input.
